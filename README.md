Threads Synchronization Experiment
==================================
###Problem Statement
IndianRail has decided to improve its efficiency by automating not just its trains but also its passengers. From now on, passengers will be robots. Each robot and each train is controlled by a thread. You have been hired to write synchronization functions that will guarantee orderly loading of trains.

###Compiling the code
First, you need to clone the code into your local (or VM) machine as follows: 
```
git clone https://github.com/manishkotni/IndianRail_Automation.git
```

Then compile the code by runnig:
```
make
```
You can then run the program using:
```
./run
```
